------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Having reviewed my work I feel my work falls in the excellent category. I rate myself this as:

	- Data Model: 	I have implemented the Person, Member, Student Member, Premium Member, Trainer, Assessment,
			InputReader, Responder and SupportSystem classes
			
			Member assessments query support 
			Assessments queries can be used to return data that can in turn be used to:
			- Calculate BMI rates
			- Calculate the BMi category
			- Check if a member is of an ideal weight
			- List members of an ideal weight
			- Convert details to imperial and metric values
			- List members in certain BMI categories. 

	- API: 		I have a fully featured API with methods for the following:
			- Add a member (GymAPI class - addMember - line 38)
			- Add a trainer (GymAPI class - addTrainer - line 43)
			- Returning the number of members (GymAPI class - numberOfMembers - line 48)
			- Returning the number of trainers (GymAPI class - numberOfTrainers - line 53) 
			- Search for a member by email (GymAPI class - searchMembersByEmail - line 74)
			- Search for a member by name (GymAPI class - searchMembersByName - line 88)
			- Search for a trainer by email (GymAPI class - searchTrainersByEmail - line 110) 
			- Search for a trainer by name (GymAPI class - searchTrainersByName - line 124)
			- Returning a list of members (GymAPI class - listMembers - line 145)
			- List member by a specific BMI category (GymAPI class - listMembersBySpecificBMICategory - line 171)
			- Return a list of members with an ideal weight (GymAPI class - listMembersWithIdealWeight() line 153)
			- Return a list of all members with their weight and height details imperial and metric values 
		  	  (GymAPI - listMemberDetailsImperialAndMetric - line 233)
			
		
			Fully featured Utility class with methods for the following:
			- To calculate a members BMI (GymUtility - calculateBMI - line 13)
			- To determine a members BMI category (GymUtility - determineBMICategory - line 31)
			- To determine if member is of ideal body weight or not (GymUtility - isIdealBodyWeight - line 50)

	- Menu:		A Person can:
			- Register
			- Login
	
			A Member can:
			- View their Profile
			- Update their Profile
			- Search for a trainer by email
			- Search for a trainer by name
			- Get live support from the support system

			A member can view a progress sub menu where they can
			- View their weight progress
			- View their waist progress
			- View their thigh progress
			- View all comments on their assessments
			- View the last assessments comments

			A Trainer can:
			- Add a new member
			- List all members
			- Search for a member by email
			- Search for a member by name
			- List all members with an ideal weight
			- List members in a certain BMI category
			- List member details imperially and metrically

			A Trainer can view an assessment sub menu where they can	
			- Add an assessment to a members account
			- Update a comment on an assessment 	
	
	- Input validation examples:
			- The date inputted for a members assessment is validated by checking the pattern and if the date is valid
			  (MenuController - isValidDate method - line 1029)
			- Input for height and weight is checked against maximum and minimum values, if the input falls outside of 
			  the maximum and minimum values they are asked to input a valid value
                        - Input for login or register is validated - If the member enters anything other than l for login, 
			  r for register or x for exit. The user told the input is incorrect and are prompted to enter a valid input.
			- Input for asking a person if they are a member or trainer - if the user inputs anything other than m for
			  member, t for trainer or x for exit. The user is told the input is incorrect and are prompted to enter a 
			  valid input.      

	- XML persistence - data can be loaded from an xml file ( GymAPI - load() - line 276)
			 or data can be saved to an xml file (GymAPI - store() - line 265)

	A statement of how much of the application specification you implemented.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	I feel I have implemented all of the specification

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Any extra features you wish to bring to the assessors attention, i.e. extra functionality, Java syntax not covered in the 
	lectures, non-standard Libraries used
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	I implemented a member support system (SystemSupport class, InputReader class and Responder class) 
	This allows a member to input a question. The question or sentence is split into words and each word is checked to see if it is 
	a keyword. If it is a keyword the responder sends back the corresponding response, otherwise a random default response is returned 
	to the user.
	Keywords are: gained, bmi, ideal, assessment, profile, unmotivated, bad, 1, 2, 3, wit, packages and next. 

	I used the Pattern class (MainController - line 1031)
	I used this class to check the user input date for an assessment matches the pattern yy/mm/dd.

	I used the Java simpleDateFormat class (MainController - line 1034)
	I used this class to convert the string input for the assessment date to a Date.

	I use ParseException (MainController - line 1039)
	This checks for an parse exception - if the date is not a valid date this exception will be thrown

	I used the TreeSet class (Member - line 120)
	I used this to sort the assessment dates in date order.

	I looked at the following article which helped me with using the Pattern class for checking the input pattern of the 
	Assessment date

	I looked at the following article/code which helped me with using the SimpleDateFormat class and ParseException, 
	for converting a string to a Date and checking if the date is a valid date.
